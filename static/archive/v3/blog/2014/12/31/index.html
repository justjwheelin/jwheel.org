		<p>Permanence.</p>

		<p>What is it? What do you mean when you say it? What is an example? Can you elaborate?</p>

		<p>Permanence is an element of human nature that is almost completely derived from imagination. It is something we perceive to be “normal” after noticing a recurring trend of patterns in a particular event or activity. After that, it then becomes habitual or so regular to the point that we may perceive it as being a permanent element and piece of our lives, when in reality, we can never be certain that it really is permanent.</p>

		<p>So, then, how can something such as a parent not be permanent? Or how can our identity and how we perceive ourselves to be not be permanent? The answer is almost sadistically simple.</p>

		<p>Parents usually play an omnipresent role in their children’s lives, but there will come a point where that presence comes to an abrupt or sudden halt. Perhaps it may be a medical issue that causes unexpected complications, or it may just be the point where they have reached their maximum age. Or for some, maybe it is because their parent or parents disappeared, leaving hardly a trace about their intentions or whereabouts. For these reasons, even something as a parental figure that we take for granted is something that is not actually permanent, but on the contrary, they are just someone who repeatedly has a starring role in the melodrama of our lives.</p>

		<p>But what about identity, or who we are? That’s something we carry for our entire lives, from birth to death. We can never change what we are, some might think. But is that really so? Identity and self-perception are debatedly two of the most fragile and moldable substances in our lives. Our self-identity and who we perceive ourselves to be changes throughout the different eras of our lives. If you consider it, who we are as children is quite different from who we are as teenagers, or adults, and beyond. We’re never the same person from start to finish. We may be similar, but completely the same? Never. With age, we gain more maturity and wisdom. We gain more insight into reality and slowly emerge from our bubble of dependency. With age also comes regret and wistful thinking. Things we wish we had done but never did. Days we want to relive and do differently, but cannot. But maybe in the current time, you know for a fact you would handle a particular situation differently than you would have at a different age. Thus, your identity has changed. You have transitioned from state of thought to another. The theory of permanence is evaporated.</p>

		<p>Even though permanence may only be an imagined concept, that does not necessarily imply that there is no saving salvation from change. Rather, we have the beauty of the transition.</p>

		<p>Transitions are one of the most underrated yet blindly accepted concepts of human nature that exist. All throughout our life, we are constantly transitioning. At this very moment, you are in the process of changing, of becoming someone else, of thinking in a different way, of become older, of getting closer to some important deadline… you are changing right now.</p>

		<p>But that is not inherently bad.</p>

		<p>Rather, if handled correctly, you might find that it is possible to derive a positive emotion from your personal transitions.</p>
