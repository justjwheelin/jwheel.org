My responsibilities include the following, related to all things Free and Open Source:

* Technical assistance
* Open source support

#### UNICEF MagicBox, Office of Innovation

From January - May 2018, I was the first, full-time co-op placement to work exclusively on Open Source community for [UNICEF Office of Innovation][1].

I supported [MagicBox][3], a geospatial data project connecting unrelated datasets into actionable feedback for local governments and municipalities.
I improved Open Source best practices to enable continuous integration, agile development practices, and created a 12 month Open Source community roadmap.
There, I worked together with UNICEF personnel and [Red Hat Open Innovations Lab][4] on MagicBox.
This was an engagement highlighted by Jim Whitehurst, former President of I.B.M. and Red Hat C.E.O., during his [Red Hat Summit 2018 keynote][5].
