In October 2022, I joined [Red Hat][1] as the fourth [_Fedora Community Architect_][2] (FCA).
The FCA is a full-time, Red Hat-employed job to lead initiatives to grow the Fedora user and developer communities, and to make Red Hat and Fedora interactions even more transparent and positive.

I am excited to bring [my long-time passion and drive][3] for Fedora into a full-time capacity.
I am still new to this role, so I am focused on learning my way around Red Hat and connecting that into what I do in Fedora.
Check back soon to know more about what I am focused on at Red Hat.
