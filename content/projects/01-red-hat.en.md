In October 2022, I joined [Red Hat][1] as the fourth [_Fedora Community Architect_][2] (FCA).
The Fedora Community Architect (FCA) is employed full-time by Red Hat to lead initiatives that grow the Fedora user and developer communities.
They also help make Red Hat and Fedora interactions more transparent and open.

Although I continue several of my capacities [as a long-time Fedora Project contributor][3], my role at Red Hat directs my focus in a few specific areas:

* **Architectural support**:
  Guidance, coaching, and mentoring on how to participate and contribute in the Fedora community.
  This includes mentoring to community volunteers as well as my Red Hat colleagues working on downstream products who also contribute upstream.
* **Community leadership**:
  Participate in community leadership bodies (e.g. Fedora Council, Mindshare Committee) to represent the interests of Red Hat and the motivations of our contributor community.
  I also participate in discussion and execution around strategic direction for the Fedora Project.
* **Events**:
  Global in-person and virtual events are a primary focus of my role.
  This includes organization of the [Flock contributor conference][4] and other regional events, such as [FOSDEM][5], [DevConf CZ][6], [SCaLE][7], and others.
  It is also inclusive of the various virtual events that we run throughout the year, such as Fedora release parties, Fedora Week of Diversity, Fedora Appreciation Week, and others.
* **Financial forecasting and budgeting**:
  Planning, forecasting, recording, and coordinating payments from the Fedora Project fiscal budget, provided by Red Hat.
  I work with various stakeholders to account for how Fedora spends its financial resources, mostly around SaaS services, event planning and execution, and marketing resources (i.e. swag).
* **Swag**:
  I maintain the global inventory of Fedora swag and I am responsible for ordering new items into our inventory.
  I work with contributors around the world to distribute items for regional and community events.

There are many other aspects of the Fedora community that I support through my role, but these are the major highlights.
