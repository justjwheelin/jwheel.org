In October 2022, I joined [Red Hat][1] as the fourth [_Fedora Community Action & Impact Coordinator_][2] (FCAIC, or F-ðŸŽ‚).
The Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator (or FCAIC) is a full-time, Red Hat-employed job to lead initiatives to grow the Fedora user and developer communities, and to make Red Hat and Fedora interactions even more transparent and positive.

I am excited to bring [my long-time passion and drive][3] for Fedora into a full-time capacity!
I recently began this role in Fedora, so I am focused on settling in and catching up on what is happening across the widely-distributed, global Fedora Community.

Check back soon to know more about what I am working on at Red Hat.
