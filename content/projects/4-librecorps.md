From August 2018 to April 2020, I was a leading member of the [LibreCorps][1] program of the [FOSS@MAGIC initiative][2] at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

From 2018-2020, RIT LibreCorps collaborated with the [UNICEF Innovation Fund][3], a pooled funding vehicle to quickly assess, fund and grow open-source solutions that have been developed in new and emerging markets.
I provided expertise and mentorship for developing sustainable communities around open source projects for RIT LibreCorps partners like the Innovation Fund.
In 2019, I led multiple half-day workshops together with [Prof. Stephen Jacobs][4] for UNICEFâ€™s [Innovation Fund][3] to introduce over 20 international start-up teams to the Open Source way.
