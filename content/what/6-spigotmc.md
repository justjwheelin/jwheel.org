From April 2014 to October 2016, I was a community moderator and staff member of the open source [SpigotMC project][1].

There, I handled user reports for a community forum with over 400,000 registered members.
I also replied to support emails and directly worked with users to solve problems.
I was a co-conspirator for Spigot's event planning for the annual Minecraft convention, MINECON, in London 2015 and [Anaheim 2016][2].
This is one of the most unique communities I have worked in, as the Spigot Community is a population of hundreds of thousands with an age demographic concentrated between ages 13-25.
