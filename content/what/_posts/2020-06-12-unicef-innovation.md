#### Open Source Software Technical Advisor

Since June 2020, I work as a full-time independent contractor at the [UNICEF Office of Innovation][1].
There, I support the [UNICEF Innovation Fund][2] as their first-ever _Open Source Software Technical Advisor_.
My responsibilities include the following, related to Free and Open Source Software:

* Technical assistance
* Open source support
* Cohort collaboration
* Assessment support
* Metrics assessment
* Sustainability assessment

#### UNICEF MagicBox

From January - May 2018, I was the first, full-time co-op placement to work exclusively on open source community for [UNICEF Office of Innovation][1].

I supported [MagicBox][3], a geospatial data project connecting unrelated datasets into actionable feedback for local governments and municipalities.
I improved open source best practices to enable continuous integration, agile development practices, and created a 12 month open source community roadmap.
There, I worked together with UNICEF personnel and [Red Hat Open Innovations Lab][4] on MagicBox.
This was an engagement highlighted by Jim Whitehurst, President of I.B.M. and former Red Hat C.E.O., during his [Red Hat Summit 2018 keynote][5].
