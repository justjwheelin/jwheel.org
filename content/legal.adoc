[[declaration]]
== Declaration and Intent

This document (hereinafter "Notice") serves as a public declaration by Justin Wheeler (the "Original Creator") of the default licensing terms governing all Code and Content (as defined herein) created by the Original Creator (collectively, "Contributions").

It is the Original Creator's intent to proactively establish clear, open licensing for all Contributions.
This Notice applies to any company, enterprise, organization, or individual offering digital services (the "Service Provider") that stores, hosts, processes, transmits, or otherwise interacts with any Contribution.

Service Providers are put on notice that by choosing to store or otherwise make use of any Contribution from the Original Creator, they acknowledge these terms.
Service Providers agree that such Contributions are governed by the "Current Default License" (as defined herein), unless a separate, explicit written agreement signed by the Original Creator dictates otherwise for a specific Contribution.
An exception exists where the Service Provider's own published terms of service, affirmatively and explicitly agreed to by the Original Creator for a specific service, directly and unavoidably conflict with a specific provision herein regarding the scope of license granted *to that specific Service Provider for the operation of its service*.


[[application]]
== Application of Default Licensing

. All Contributions made available by the Original Creator are offered under a "Current Default License" as defined in this Notice.
. A Contribution is governed by the Current Default License from the moment of its creation and fixation.
. This applies especially if the Contribution is not accompanied by separate, explicit licensing terms by the Original Creator that override this Notice.
. The Service Provider is expected to fully comply with all terms and conditions of the applicable Current Default License for any Contribution they store, host, process, or otherwise utilize.
. This includes, but is not limited to, requirements for attribution, modification, and redistribution as specified by the respective license.
. Non-compliance with the terms of the Current Default License by the Service Provider constitutes a violation of the license under which the Contribution is offered.


[[interpretation]]
== Primacy and Interpretation

This Notice establishes the foundational licensing terms for all Contributions.
Any ambiguity between this Notice and any other general terms or policies of a Service Provider (not explicitly and separately agreed to in writing by the Original Creator) shall be resolved in favor of the terms set forth in this Notice.
This resolution applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.
This Notice acts as the Original Creator's standing instruction and licensing declaration for all Contributions.
